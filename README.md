# Indoor-Farming-Pods-
The objective of this project is to develop **Smart Modular Indoor Farming Pods** that enable urban residents to grow herbs, leafy greens, and small vegetables in a compact, sustainable, and convenient way. The project aims to create a modular system that can be expanded to fit different household spaces and incorporates sensors to monitor water, humidity, and light, ensuring optimal growing conditions. A companion mobile app will guide users with real time tips on watering, nutrients, and harvesting, making it accessible even for first-time growers. 

This project is about showcasing the Project Management skills that I pocess, from ideation to the development of a product, managing different stages of the project.
